According to the documentation:

$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'file' => 'max:500000',
]);

The value is in kilobytes. I.e. max:10240 = max 10 MB.

    Well... if it were in kilobytes as the documentation states, it should be max:10000 for 10 MB. Otherwise, the documentation should refer to the size as Kibibytes or KiB – shock_gone_wild Jan 3 '18 at 13:26
    The value is in kilobytes. I.e. max:10240 = max 10 MB. So that means 'file' => 'max:1' means 1 kilobyte? – Marvin May 17 '19 at 15:06

if the value is already in kilobytes, then it should just be 10000, the 1024 multiplier only applies when going from bits to bytes. – AaronHS Oct 10 '19 at 3:33
This solution did not work for me. System uploaded 6.5 MB image. Code is $validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [ 'profile_image'=>'mimes:jpeg,jpg,png|max:2000' ]); – Kamlesh Feb 8 at 8:23
